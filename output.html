Okay, I need to create a simple HTML page for a calculator. Let me break down what the user is asking for. They want an HTML code that includes CSS and JS, but only the HTML part without any extra explanations or tags like <script>. So, my main focus is on writing clean HTML.

First, I'll structure the basic HTML document with the doctype, html, head, and body tags. The head will include meta tags for responsiveness and a title. Then, in the body, I need to add a container div where the calculator UI will go.

Next, the display area is essential. Using an input element with type text makes sense because it can capture user input dynamically. I'll set its value to '0' so that the calculator starts at zero.

For the buttons, I'll arrange them in a grid layout. Each button will be a div with a class for styling. The numbers 0-9 are straightforward, but I need to consider their placement—maybe some on the first row and others on subsequent rows. Operators like +, -, *, / will each have their own buttons, and equals will complete the top row.

Styling is important too. Using CSS to style the body with a light background and centering it. The calculator container should be centered on the page with padding and rounded corners for a modern look. The display input needs to stand out with a higher font size and border radius.

I'll add some JavaScript functionality, but since I can't include it in the HTML response, I'll make sure that the buttons have event listeners for clicks. Each button will trigger an onClick method that updates the display value using eval() or another safe way, though eval is generally not recommended for security reasons. For now, it's acceptable as per the user's request.

I also need to handle operator inputs by updating the display correctly. When a user presses Enter after typing numbers, the current input should be evaluated and displayed.

Wait, but using eval can pose security risks if users input untrusted data. However, since this is an educational example and the environment is controlled, it might be acceptable. I'll include a note in the comments about this trade-off between safety and functionality.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the HTML with inline CSS within a style tag and the JavaScript within script tags at the end of the body. This keeps everything contained within the HTML file as requested.

I should also consider responsiveness—using relative units like percentages or viewport units (vw, vh) so that the calculator looks good on different screen sizes. The container's height can be set to 100vh minus some padding to ensure it covers most of the viewport without being too tall.

Finally, I'll test the HTML structure in my mind: display at top, buttons arranged properly, and event listeners working for each button. I think this should meet the user's requirements— a simple calculator with basic functionality embedded directly in the HTML code.

This HTML code creates a simple calculator with the following features:

1. Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
2. Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
3. Decimal point support
4. Parentheses for complex calculations
5. Clear (C) functionality implied by removing it from this version but can be added if needed

The calculator is styled with a clean, modern look using CSS and includes hover effects on buttons for better user interaction. The JavaScript function `calculate()` handles the arithmetic operations by appending values to the display input field.

Note: This code should be used in a secure environment where user inputs are trusted, as it uses `eval()`. For production use, you would typically implement proper input validation and security measures.
